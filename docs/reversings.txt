Dragon NVRAM has 2 encrypted areas:
region area at offset 0x1C6
patch area at offset 0x320

region area consists of 2 10-byte blocks. Last 2 bytes in each block - checksum. 1st checksum byte is useless and skipped during decryption.
First 8byte block - random value used for encrypting the second block. Can be anything.
The second block consists of 2 parts - a random 2-byte block, and a 6-byte block containing region falgs. A random 2-byte block can be of anything.
6-byte block bit flags are described on PSX dev wiki. In short - the highest byte contains 8 possible classic regions (from Japan to Mexico).
On all models is set only exactly one bitflag is in the highest byte, so only one region is assigned (with the only exception - Review Kit).
2nd byte purpose is unknown - always all bits are cleared (except Review Kit: all bits are set).
3rd byte contains ps2 types and the main mechapwn flag allowing you to change console type to the arcade, prototype, dtl, semi-dtl, etc.
4-6 byte purpose unknown - always all bits cleared.

The Patch area contains 2 blocks 112 bytes long. Last 2 bytes in each block - checksum. 1st checksum byte is useless and skipped during decryption.
After decryption these 2 blocks combined in one block: 216 bytes long (2 x 108)
This block structure:
struct rom_patch
{
	uint32_t address[4];
	uint32_t value[4];
	uint32_t svc_address[4];
	uint8_t payload[168];
	uint32_t crc;
};

First 16 bytes - 4 addresses inside mechacon rom that should be patched, next 16 bytes - 4 values that are written over at those addresses.
If the address is zero, then the patch is skipped.
Next 16 bytes - 4 svc_addresses (TODO: describe what that means)
The rest is for payload (168 bytes) and checksum (TODO: provide more information about payload)

The current Force Unlock implementation uses 2 patches. All Sony retail patches (except PSX1 5.10 and 6.02 ver b used in 70k) use a maximum 2 patches, so there is space for 2 patches:

TODO: explain what exactly Force Unlock is patching.

PSX doesn't need force unlock.
For 6.02 original ver b patch gets rewritten to free up patch addresses. The original 4-patch set is lowered to a 1-patch set.
TODO: provide source code for 6.02 rewritten payload.

6.00 and 6.02 mechacon firmware contains a bug: DVDVideo disk stop working if the DTL flag is set.
